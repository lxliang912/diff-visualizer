# Diff Visualizer

A VSCode/Cursor extension to visualize file changes and commit history between Git branches.

## Background

In Cursor 1.7 and earlier versions, there was a built-in feature to compare branches and view all file changes. However, this feature was removed in later versions. This extension was developed to bring back that functionality.

## Features

- **Branch Comparison**: Select two branches and instantly see all file changes
- **File Tree View**: Display changed files in a directory structure with expand/collapse support
- **Commit History Graph**: Visualize commit history between branches with a graphical representation
- **Quick Diff**: Click any file to open VSCode's built-in diff view

## Usage

1. Click the **Diff Visualizer** icon in the sidebar
2. Select the base branch and target branch
3. Browse the file changes list and commit history
4. Click a file to view detailed differences
